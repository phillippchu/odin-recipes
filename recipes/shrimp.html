        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Quickly rinse shrimp under cold water to remove any ice or sediment.
            Pat dry with paper towels. Place shrimp in one layer in the basket
            of the air fryer and lightly mist with cooking spray. You may have
            to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air-fry shrimp for 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking shrimp until
            shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 3 to 4
            minutes longer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, place butter in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat butter
            at 50 percent power until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Mix in hot sauce
            and Old BayÂ® seasoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place cooked shrimp into a large bowl. Drizzle with butter mixture
            and toss to coat. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
