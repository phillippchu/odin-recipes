        <h2>Greatest Fried Chicken of All Time</h2>
        <p>
          Karaage is a Japanese-style fried chicken that is crispy, tender, and
          rich in flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to cooking the best Karaage is using potato starch to coat
          your chicken.

          </li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black
            pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly and evenly
            coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a foil-lined
            baking sheet. Add potato starch to a wide, shallow bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with marinade.
            Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly
            coated. Shake off any excess starch and place chicken on the wire
            rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of
            starch, then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to the
            refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in
            batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the
            outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper
            towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.
